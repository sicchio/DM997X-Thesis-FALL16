## DELIVERABLES FOR IDM ARCHIVES 

*Direct message the dropbox link or google drive folder link to deangela on slack.*

If you want to create a dropbox account and have not already done so, let me know. Both you and I can get additional free space if I invite you.

Each student will provide their own **dropbox link**. A dropbox link is actually different than sharing an actual *dropbox folder*. Here’s a how to: https://www.dropbox.com/help/167 (There is also a video explaining how to do it later in the page as well.) 
 
Create a dropbox link (NOT folder, see above) or google drive folder that contains the following. Make sure all filenames include your name and ms thesis fa15 and descriptive text of the content: 
* PDFs
 * Final Thesis Paper
 * Final Thesis Defense Presentation
 * Letter to Next Cohort (see description below)
 * Resume and Cover Letter
 * URLs to the following all on one page 
   * thesis process website
   * portfolio website
   * linkedin profile
   * any other social media presences where you promote your work (instagram, twitter, facebook group or page, etc.) 
* Photo documentation (for all students)
  * ***at least*** 3, hi-res images of your project (RAW preferably or 300dpi)
* Video or Audio documentation (varies by student)
 *  If creating a screen-based, digital application (website, mobile app, game, etc.), create video documentation by screen capturing a user interacting with your digital project.
 *  If creating a physical object, musical instrument, physical game, or interactive installation, create video documentation of a user interacting with your physical project.
 *  If creating a performance or event, please provide video documentation of the performance or event.
 * If creating any sort of moving image (animation, film, motion graphics, video web series, etc.), please provide compressed video files of your moving image.
 *  If creating an audio podcast, provide mp3s of all podcasts.
 *  If creating any print medium, provide an original copy of it or provide a digital copy of it (preferably pdf).

## PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

NOTE: This is different than your <a href="dm4003_thesis_website.md">Thesis Process Website</a>.

This website should market and promote your body of work for possible employment or other post graduation opportunities. This site should NOT be hosted on http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu. Ideally, you should have your own domain name. 


## LETTER TO NEXT COHORT 

*As a pdf, direct message to deangela on Slack.*
* Please name your file as firstnameinitiallastname_thesis_fa15_letter.pdf (i.e. dduff_thesis_fa15_letter.pdf) 
* Also make sure that you  have a header within the actual document.  i.e. Your Name / Spring 2016 /  IDM MS Thesis / Letter to Next Cohort.

Write a letter to the next class giving them advice on how to succeed with their thesis paper, project, and defense. (What would you do differently if you could start the course again? What would you do the same?)
