Read [Indiana University's How To Write a Thesis Statement](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/thesis_statement.shtml) BEFORE you answer the following question and write your thesis statement.

 * First, ask yourself **what question is your research trying  to answer?** (Please reference the above link.)
    

   
    * Secondly, turn that question into a statement. (Please reference the above link.)
    * Do not use **I** in your thesis statement.

 
* **What is your "elevator pitch" / Thesis Statement?**<br>
Keep in mind, "What is the project about? What is its theme?"

    * It is one sentence, not a paragraph.

    
    * Here's a guide for a starting point: 
    * ***(Working Title)* is a *(What is it?)* that *(What does it do?)* for *(Your Audience)* to *(Why? What's the purpose)*.** 

    * *Note: Obviously you would not leave in the parentheses; it's a just a marker to denote what you should add.*

* **List your thesis advisor:**

 * Why did you select this person to be your thesis advisor?

 * Did you meet with him/her over the winter break? If yes, how many times? What did you discuss/question/decide with your thesis advisor over the winter break?

 * Have you worked out a schedule to meet with him/her over this semester? If so, when and how often? If not, do so immediately.

 * If you don’t have a thesis advisor, who have you been in contact with? What was their response? What area(s) of expertise are your seeking in a thesis advisor?

* **Discuss your winter progress**
    * What did you do over the winter break to make progress on your **project**? If you did not work on your project over the winter break, own it and say so.

    * What did you do over the winter break to make progress on your **paper**? If you did not work on your paper over the winter break, own it and say so.

    * How has your project transformed or shifted over the winter break AND why?

* Distinguish Scott McCloud’s six
steps of the creative process in relation to your thesis project. 
 1. Idea/Purpose-Content
 2. Form-Manifestation (book, sculpture, film?)
 3. Idiom-Context, style, genre
 4. Structure-Composition, what to include, NOT include!
 5. Craft- practical implementation, getting the job done.
 6. Surface-finishing, superficial face of the work-usually this is the easiest part.
