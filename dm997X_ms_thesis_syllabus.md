## Welcome to MS Thesis In Digital Media!

This is the second semester of a two-semester sequence culminating in a thesis defense, a thesis paper, a thesis project, and thesis website, accomplished through a combination of questioning, researching, building/making, writing, iterating, and presenting.


### PROGRAM GOALS

The following IDM program goals are reinforced within this course. At a graduate level, students will:

* develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
  * Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
  * Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
  * Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.
* develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

### COURSE GOALS

This course will help students deeply:
* question
* research
* build/make
* write
* iterate
* present

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course, students will be able to develop, complete, and document a thesis that is meaningful and carefully crafted to be used for professional purposes (employment, gallery shows, funding, starting a business, etc.).


### COURSE STRUCTURE

Students are expected to be on time for all meetings, critiques, and presentations. Due to the number of students in this class, you will be assigned to group A or B for individual meetings and/or presentation schedules.

This class will consist of
* Lecture
* Group Discussion
* Individual Meetings
* In-class Peer Critiques
* [Project Demos and Critique](project_demo.md)
* [Mock Thesis Defenses and Critique](dm997X_ms_thesis_mock_defense.md)
* [Thesis Defense](dm997X_ms_thesis_defense.md)
* Self Assessment

**Individual Meetings**<br>The order of our weekly, individual 20 minute status meetings will be determined on the first day of class. We will alternate weeks between group A and B. Be prepared to present and discuss your work at your appointed time. Students should plan ahead and ensure that technical requirements necessary for the review of work are addressed *prior* to meeting with the instructor. 

Individual meetings are not optional. They are important and useful. Sometimes
they are most useful exactly when you feel you have nothing to talk about or show. It is normal that you may sometimes have nothing "good" to show, or even nothing at all. It is still important that you keep your appointment so that we can talk about that. If for some unusual reason you cannot make your appointment one week, please show professional courtesy and let me know ahead of time.

**In-class peer critiques**<br>While I am meeting with your fellow classmates, it is mandatory that you receive peer critique on whatever you are currently working on. You should not be working on anything during peer critique. You should be giving feedback to a fellow classmate. When you are finished with one classmate, find another. Rinse and repeat.

**[Project Demos]() & [Mock Thesis Defenses](dm997X_ms_thesis_mock_defense.md)**<br>Project demos or mock thesis defenses will be held on designated Wednessdays, and will consist of the professor, ALL thesis students, and outside critics, at times. 

**Self Assessment**
Students will also conduct self assessments as well as be evaluated by the professor throughout the semester. Any action without reflection is meaningless. Real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. 


### COMMUNICATING WITH THE PROFESSOR OUTSIDE OF CLASS

* Direct message on Slack about logistics (when, where, how many?) ONLY
* Talk to me in person directly after class, during your status meeting, or set up an appointment about issues and problems. DO NOT direct message long conversations. (If your direct message turns into paragraphs that means you should be talking to me in person not direct messaging me.)


### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort). 
* Come to class on time. 
* Participate in class. Be vocal.
* Present your work. 
* Meet, individually, with the professor during your scheduled time to discuss your thesis progress.
* Meet weekly with your thesis accountablity partner
* Consult slack  at least once a week for up to date info.
* Maintain a weekly, dedicated, thesis process website.
* Complete all deliverables by their due dates.
* Acquire and read copies of the required book.
* Action – do your absolute best.
* Strive for continuous improvement.
* Pay attention to detail & craft.
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects.
* Have fun!


### STUDENT VALUES

* Commitment
* Patience
* Focus
* Daily Discipline
* Persistence


### EVALUATION & GRADING

##### Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory during project critiques, individual status meetings, and mock thesis defenses. If you miss an individual status meeting, it is your responsibility to exchange a time with a fellow classmate. 
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.625 percent
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (in person or by email is preferred).

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

##### Quantitative Grading Overview

* 50% Thesis Defense (which includes [Thesis Paper](dm997X_ms_thesis_paper.md) and [Thesis Project](dm997X_ms_thesis_project.md))
* 16% [End of Semester Deliverables](dm997xmsthesis_end_of_semester_deliverables.md)
* 11% Weekly Progress: Project Milestones (aka what have you done this week?) on [Thesis Process Website](dm997X_ms_thesis_website.md) and Calendar
* 10% Mock Thesis Defenses
* 10% Project Demo Critiques
* 03% Self Assessment & Rubrics

*Extra Credit: Career Counseling Appt. through NYU's Wasserman Center*

##### Qualitative Grading Overview

You will be judged on the quality, iteration, completion, and presentation of your thesis. 

* **A Excellent** (Work of exceptional quality; Exceeds Expectations)
* **A- Very Good** (Work of high quality)
* **B+ Good** (Solid work; Meets Expectations)
* **B Satisfactory** (Good work; Satisfies course requirements)
* **B- Needs Improvement**  (Below average work)
* **C+ Poor Work** (Well Below Average)
* **C Inadequate** (Less than adequate work)
* **F Unacceptable** (The performance and/or attendance of the student has failed course requirements.)


### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, myspace, etc. **When your classmates are presenting, please close your laptops and turn off your cell phones.**
